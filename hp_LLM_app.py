    This app allows you to fulfill every pre-Y2K office professional's dream: figure out why the printer isn't working! 
    The proof of concept is made specifically to get experience with Langchain's Parent Document Retriever (PDR). The PDR helps maximize the pros and minimize the cons 
    of some of the properties that occur with different size chunking and embedding text data. The idea is that large chunks lose accuracy but maintain context, while small chunks 
    are essentially memorized and lose context, which can hinder creativity in interpretation and a bots's output. I like to make the analogy that small chunks are rote memorization of 
    concepts for a test, while large chunks lose the detail that rote memorization provides they allow a high level overview that is used in life outside of tests. 
    As of 9/27/23, this app is a proof of concept project. The chatbot does not have any short term memory and will not work well on certain questions. The text from the pdf has been minimally 
    processed for the sake of time and the LLM has been instructed to summarize the text as the text data is a bit messy. If the output you receive is not relevant or very strange, please reach out to me 
    on LinkedIn and I will look into it.
